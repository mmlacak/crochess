Naming and organization                         {#organization}
=======================

Describes where to find, and what.

Naming
------

To avoid name collisions with other code, libraries, all entities are prefixed with
`cc_`, `CC_`, or `Cc`, depending if they are functions and modules, `#define`s and `const`ants,
or `enum`s and `struct`s, respectively.

Functions and modules names are lowercase words, separated by `_` (underscore),
e.g. `cc_ply.h`, `cc_ply_append_new()`.

`#define`s and `const`ants names are uppercase words, separated by `_` (underscore),
e.g. `CC_OFF_BOARD_COORD`, `CC_SETUP_BOARD_CLASSICAL_CHESS`.

`enum`s and `struct`s names are capitalized words.
`enum` names end in `Enum`, while there is no comparable name end for `struct`s.
Examples, `CcPlyLinkEnum`, `CcPly`.

`enum` items have constant-like library prefix (i.e. `CC_`), combined with abbreviated `enum` name
(e.g. `PLE_`) and capitalized words for item name.
For instance, `CC_PLE_FailedTeleportationOblation` would be one of items in `CcPlyLinkEnum`.

Organization
------------

Items (pieces, tags, variants, moves, plies, steps) introduced in [the book] are represented
in the samely named files (headers and sources), e.g. `cc_piece`, `cc_tag`, `cc_variant`,
`cc_move`, `cc_ply`, `cc_step`.

Board (as a holder of pieces) and tags are combined in a `cc_chessboard` files. Initial setup
for those can be found in `cc_setup_board` and `cc_setup_tags` files.

Moves are applied as a transformation to a chessboard in `cc_do_moves` files.
Functions in this module assume that argument(s) are correct, so there are only a few sanity checks.

Moves are formatted into algebraic notation in a `cc_format_moves` files.
These functions too assume that argument(s) are correct, so there are only a few sanity checks.

Parser messages are located in `cc_parse_msg` files. Move parsing module (`cc_parse_move` files)
is not finished yet.

House-keeping utilities are comprised of the rest of modules:
- `cc_define.h` contains `#define`s used across modules
- `cc_str_utils` files, various string related functions
- `cc_tokenizer` files, primitive tokenizer for CLI commands issued by user
- `cc_version` files, library version

Versioning
----------

Library version defined in `cc_version.c` file is a reference version for the whole project.
Other applications (`crochess`, `tests`) and libraries (implementing bots) are defining
`libcrochess` library version as their own.

In turn, `libcrochess` library version is updated every time source code anywhere in the
project is updated, regardless if updated code is actually in the library, or elsewhere.

Versioning scheme used is
[**Natural Versioning 1.2**](https://croatian-chess.blogspot.com/p/natver.html "Natural Versioning 1.2").

Finally, a word of caution. Function reference documentation include "Referenced-by" and
"Referencing" fields, in hope that they will be useful, which, for the most part, they are.
However, doxygen C parser consistently confuses local variable(s) `i`, `r`, `s`, ... as
referencing static one(s) in `cc_setup_board.c`, `cc_setup_tags.c` files, e.g. in the
description of `cc_chessboard_as_string_new()`.
Please, ignore.
