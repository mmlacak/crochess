    @note
    Argument `*route_pin__io_a_F` contains currently pinned route when iterator is called. <br />
    If function returns `true`, it contains next route found in a given path tree.

    @note
    Argument `*route_pin__io_a_F` can be `NULL` at the beginning of iteration, <br />
    it will be initialized with first route found in a given path tree.

    @warning
    When iterator founds no more routes to traverse, it will **free** last pinned route, <br />
    and set `*route_pin__io_a_F` pointer to `NULL`, to prepare for next iterations. <br />
    The same will happen in case of any error, to prevent infinite loops.

    @warning
    Path tree **must** always be the same with which route was initialized. <br />
    To change path tree before it's traversed completely, one has to free route, reset its pointer to `NULL`, <br />
    then first call to iterator with new path tree will initialize route with it.

    @note
    Argument `route_pin__io_a_F` retains ownership of pinned route between iterator calls; <br />
    if loop is exited prematurely (or iterator is called outside of loop), one has to free
    pinned route explicitly.

    Usage example:
    @code{.c}
    CcPathNode pn; // Path tree to traverse; just a (forward) declaration.
    CcRoutePin * rp__a = NULL; // Pinned route; must be set to NULL before start iterating.

    while ( cc_route_pin_iter( pn, &rp__a ) ) {
        // Do some stuff here ...
    }
    // After loop is done (or if some error happens), route is free-ed,
    // and pointer to it set to NULL.

    // After first loop, one can immediately roll another one,
    // no free + NULL necessary, as it's already done.
    while ( cc_route_pin_iter( pn, &rp__a ) ) {
        // Do other stuff here ...
    }

    // Iterator can be initialized outside a loop, and then called as needed.
    if ( cc_route_pin_iter( pn, &rp__a ) ) {
        // Do something to first route found here ...
    }

    // All calls to iterator must be done with the same path tree which was used to initialize route.
    if ( cc_route_pin_iter( pn, &rp__a ) ) {
        // ... and to second
    }

    CcPathNode pn_2; // The other path tree; just a (forward) declaration.

    // When changing path tree before it was exhausted in iterator,
    // route must be free-ed, and pointer NULL-ed.
    cc_route_pin_free_all( &rp__a );

    // Next call initializes route with a new path tree ...
    if ( cc_route_pin_iter( pn_2, &rp__a ) ) {
        // Do something to first route found in the other tree here ...
    }

    // Pinned route pointer is owner of allocated data; if it's not free()-ed
    // (if loop hasn't finished, or iterator was called outside of loop),
    // one has to free pinned route explicitly.
    cc_route_pin_free_all( &rp__a );
