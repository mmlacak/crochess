    Functions returns a newly allocated `CcGame`, from a given string,

    @param setup A setup string.
    @param before_setup__d An _optional_, initial game. If give, it is copied before any modification specified by a given string is applied.

    @note
    Setup string contains list of `<piece><file><rank>[<tag>]` items, `<tag>` is optional.

    @note
    `<piece>` is usual piece symbol, as used in AN; dark/dim pieces are represented by lower-case letter, e.g. dark Bishop would be `b`, instead of usual `B`.

    @note
    If a particular field has to be cleared, ``' '`` (space) is used for `<piece>`.

    @note
    `<file>` is any letter from `a` to `z`, inclusive.

    @note
    `<rank>` is any number from `1` to `26`, inclusive.

    @note
    `<tag>` is optional, if given it can be one of `P`, `R`, `E`, `C`; representing delayed promotion, rushing, en passant and castling tags.

    @note
    If optional, initial game setup is not given, setup string has to be preceded by variant abbreviation, i.e. use one of:
    - cc  --> Classical Chess
    - ct  --> Croatian Ties
    - ma  --> Mayan Ascendancy
    - aoa --> Age Of Aquarius
    - mv  --> Miranda's Veil
    - n   --> Nineteen
    - hd  --> Hemera's Dawn
    - tr  --> Tamoanchan Revisited
    - cot --> Conquest Of Tlalocan
    - d   --> Discovery
    - o   --> One

    @note
    Use lower-cased variant abbreviation to set dark player on the move; otherwise, it's light player's move.

    @note
    Variant abbreviation has to be followed by ``' '`` (space).

    @note
    Some examples: `"O Ra1C,Pa2R,Pb23P,bc24,Pc7,pd8,Pf11E"`, `"o Bh5,Bd9,Wk2,Ro2"`. `"bd1, a11,Bl1,bd9"`; the last one can only be used along with an existing game setup.

    @return A newly allocated game if successful, `NULL` otherwise.
