\noindent
Conquest of Tlalocan is chess variant which is played on 24 x 24 board,
with bright red and cyan fields, and dark red and light green pieces.
Star colors are bright red and bright blue. In algebraic notation, columns
are enumerated from 'a' to 'x', and rows are enumerated from '1' to '24'.
A new piece is introduced, Shaman.

Shaman moves like sort-of cross between Knight and long-jump Unicorn,
where one figure provides step-fields, and the other capture-fields.

For light Shaman, step-fields are provided by the Knight, while capture-fields
are provided by long-range Unicorn. For dark Shaman, it's the opposite.

Shaman can continue its jumpy movement in chosen direction; over step-fields
if they're empty, over capture-fields as long as it's capturing opponent's
pieces. Shaman can't change direction once started moving.

Shaman can activate both Wave and Pyramid on its capture-fields, while only
Wave can be activated on step-fields. In all cases, activation ends Shaman's
ply.

Alternative move for Shaman is a trance-journey.

Shaman symbol in algebraic notation is 'H', to avoid confusion with Serpent.

\subsection*{Movement}

\label{sec:Conquest of Tlalocan/Shaman/Movement}

\vspace*{-1.2\baselineskip}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, keepaspectratio=true]{examples/18_cot/scn_cot_01_shaman_movement.png}
\caption{Shaman's movement}
\label{fig:scn_cot_01_shaman_movement}
\end{figure}

For this variant examples are rendered in B\&W to improve legibility.
Here, step-fields are marked green, while capture-fields are marked blue.
Note, movement of Shaman does not depend on color of field on which it
stands, only on color of the piece itself.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, keepaspectratio=true]{examples/18_cot/scn_cot_02_light_shaman_step_ply.png}
\caption{Light Shaman's step-ply}
\label{fig:scn_cot_02_light_shaman_step_ply}
\end{figure}

Once initial step-direction is chosen, light Shaman has to follow it,
and so moves similar to Pegasus. Unlike Pegasus, Shaman can't capture
opponent's pieces on step-fields, nor activate Pyramid. Wave on step-field
can be activated, and would continue to move as Shaman (and Pegasus)
would. Again, once direction is chosen, it cannot be changed, neither
in other step- nor capture-direction, even if opponent's piece is present
on a capture-field.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, keepaspectratio=true]{examples/18_cot/scn_cot_03_light_shaman_capture_ply.png}
\caption{Light Shaman's capture-ply}
\label{fig:scn_cot_03_light_shaman_capture_ply}
\end{figure}

Capture-ply can only be started with immediate capture, after which Shaman
can continue its movement as long as it keeps capturing opponent's pieces,
in the same direction. Empty capture-fields cannot be oversteped, any piece
at a distance is out of reach. Again, once started capturing, Shaman cannot
change its heading, neither in other step- nor capture-direction. Shaman
can also activate Pyramid or Wave on a capture-field, even on a first step,
thus ending its ply.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, keepaspectratio=true]{examples/18_cot/scn_cot_04_dark_shaman_step_ply.png}
\caption{Dark Shaman's step-ply}
\label{fig:scn_cot_04_dark_shaman_step_ply}
\end{figure}

Dark Shaman's step-ply is the same as light Shaman's, except it steps like a
long-jump Unicorn, in chosen direction. Shaman can't capture opponent's pieces
on step-fields, nor activate Pyramid. Wave on a step-field can be activated,
and would continue to move as dark Shaman would. Again, once direction is
chosen, it cannot be changed, neither in other step- nor capture-direction,
even if opponent's piece is present on a capture-field.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\caption{Dark Shaman's capture-ply}
\label{fig:scn_cot_05_dark_shaman_capture_ply}
\end{figure}

Dark Shaman's capture-ply is the same as light Shaman's, except it captures like
Pegasus, in chosen direction. Capture-ply can be initiated with immediate capture,
after which Shaman can continue capturing opponent's pieces, in the same direction,
if there is no empty capture-field in-between. While capturing, Shaman cannot change
its heading to any other direction. Shaman can also activate Pyramid or Wave on a
capture-field, even on its first step, thus ending its ply.

\subsubsection*{Activating Wave}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Shaman activated Wave}
\label{fig:scn_cot_06_wave_activated}
\end{figure}

Activated Wave moves the same as activating piece in the moment of activation.
So, if activated on, say,
\hyperref[fig:scn_cot_03_light_shaman_capture_ply]{light Shaman's capture-field},
Wave would move too as long-range Unicorn, in this case with momentum of 3.

Note, Wave activated by Shaman can move over its empty capture-fields, even though
Shaman itself cannot.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\subsubsection*{Teleporting Shaman}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Teleporting Shaman}
\label{sec:Conquest of Tlalocan/Shaman/Movement/Teleporting Shaman}

\vspace*{-1.4\baselineskip}
\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Teleporting Shaman}
\label{fig:scn_cot_07_teleport_shaman_all}
\end{figure}

Shaman can reach a Star and start teleporting after capturing spree (Shaman A),
by diving directly into a Star on a capture-field (B), or after a non-capturing
ply (C). In all cases, Shaman would reappear on an empty portal-field, next to a
Star in opposite color (here, any of fields 1 -- 6).

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\subsubsection*{Teleporting Pawn}

\label{fig:scn_cot_08_teleport_pawn_init}
\end{figure}

\hyperref[sec:Conquest of Tlalocan/Promotion]{Promotion in this variant is immediate}.
So, Pawn teleported to opponent's Pawn row (fields 2, 3) won't be tagged for promotion.
If teleported to opponent's \hyperref[sec:Terms/Figure row]{figure row} (field 1),
Pawn has to be promoted immediately.
Pawn teleported onto own side of a board (portal-fields 4, 5, 6) loses option to
promote, and does not gain opportunity to rush on an initial move, the same as in
\hyperref[fig:scn_n_12_teleport_pawns_step_1]{previous variant, Nineteen}.

\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Piece, when encounters own Shaman, can optionally continue its movement in direction
different to the one taken before the encounter. Direction change is divergence. After
divergence, piece is limited by momentum it had when own Shaman was encountered. \newline
\indent
Here, light Queen can diverge only from own, light Shaman; but not from opponent's,
dark Shaman.

\caption{Diverging Queen}
\label{fig:scn_cot_10_own_shaman_is_divergent_end}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
Here, light Queen (now "in the air") has reached own Shaman, and can choose a new
direction of movement independently of previous choice. Note that light Queen can
move for only 5 fields, since diverging piece is limited by momentum it had when
own Shaman was reached.

The only piece in a move, just like a piece starting a cascade,
\hyperref[fig:scn_mv_43_static_move_is_illegal_init]{cannot end its move on a starting field}.
So, in this example, starting field Q is illegal destination for light Queen.

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
Activated piece can also diverge, but it's already limited by received momentum
while going towards divergent Shaman, as it's limited after diverging.

Activated, material piece which has no momentum when own Shaman is reached cannot
diverge from it, only stop before it.

\label{fig:scn_cot_12_diverging_activated_piece_end}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
In previous example, activated Rook couldn't diverge from Shaman B, only stop before
it is reached, since all received momentum would be spent moving towards Shaman B.

The same Rook (now "in the air") can diverge from Shaman A, with 2 remaining momentum,
i.e. difference between received momentum and amount spent moving towards Shaman A.

Pawn can diverge from own Shaman by making forward-, sideways-, or capture-step,
or by rushing. After divergence, steps are available as if starting a new ply;
forward- and sideways-steps if not blocked; capture-steps if opponent's piece is
placed on a Pawn's capture-field behind own, divergent Shaman.

Diverging Pawn is limited to only one step, regardless how much momentum it had

forward, even though it had 4 momentum when light Shaman was reached. The sole

for more than one field.

Rushing Pawn can diverge from own Shaman (here, Pawns B, C), or it has to stop before

divergent Shaman closer to starting field will limit Pawn's reach (Pawn B), while

Like any other single-step piece (King, Pawn), Unicorn can diverge from own Shaman,
and make one step more; direction can be chosen independently of previous choice.
Available directions
\hyperref[fig:scn_aoa_01_unicorn_same_color]{depend on colors of Unicorn and its field};
if both are in the same color, Unicorn can do short jump; if colors are different, Unicorn
can do long jump. Just like Knight, after each jump, Unicorn changes color of its field.
So, long jump after divergence would be followed by short one,

and vice versa.

In previous example, light Unicorn made a short jump from its starting, same-color
field U. Here, it's "in the air" after diverging from Shaman on a dark field; color
of field is now opposite to Unicorn's, so Unicorn will do long jump.
After divergence Unicorn doesn't have momentum, so it can activate only own Wave,
but not Pyramid, nor Knight; or, it can capture one of opponent's pieces.

\label{sec:Conquest of Tlalocan/Trance-journey/Interactions}

Again, entranced Shaman is the one undertaking trance-journey, entrancing Shaman
is the one preceding entranced Shaman in a cascade. Interaction with other pieces
found on a step-fields depends on a color of entrancing Shaman.

If entrancing Shaman is light, pieces found on affected step-fields can be moved
(but don't have to) to an empty displacement-field. If there is no empty
displacement-field, piece is not moved.

If entrancing Shaman is dark, all pieces, own or opponent's, found on affected
step-fields are captured.

Pieces on step-fields not reached by entranced Shaman are not affected. In all
cases, Kings and Stars on a step-fields are ignored, they cannot be displaced
nor captured. Entranced Shaman can continue its trance-journey past Kings and Stars.

In all cases, entranced Shaman cannot activate neither Pyramid nor Wave. Just like
any other piece when reached upon, they can be displaced or has to be captured.

As a special case, if both Shamans are dark, entranced Shaman can undertake double
trance-journey, traveling full lenghts on both up- and down-hand patterns, capturing
all pieces on all step-fields (except Kings and Stars), after which entranced Shaman
is oblationed (i.e. removed from chessboard as if captured by the opponent).

Displacement-fields are all marked fields (blue). For comparison, Knight's
step-fields are also enumerated (grey).

Displacement is a movement of a piece (here, Rook) from Shaman's step-field directly
onto any enumerated field, regardless of how displaced piece moves otherwise.

Displacement can be performed regardless of any pieces surrounding starting or
destination fields, it is enough if destination field is empty. Destination field
must exists on chessboard, i.e. it's not possible to displace piece onto a virtual
field outside of a board.

Piece is displaced immediately after step in which entranced Shaman reaches that
piece, but before Shaman continues its trance-journey. Thus, displacement of pieces
follows order of trance-journey steps.

Multiple pieces, if not too far away, can share displacement fields. So, a piece
displaced earlier can block one later on from being displaced onto the very same
field.

Light-entranced Shaman is about to start displacing pieces along down-hand pattern
inwards, i.e. from field 1 in upper right corner of chessboard towards its starting
position.

King and Star can't be displaced, but pieces past them (here, light Knight on field 9,
dark Knight on field 12) can be displaced. Other pieces not on a step-fields of an
entranced Shaman (light Pawns) can't be displaced either.

Here, displacement-fields of light Knight are marked (blue), while for dark Pawn
they are enumerated (green).
\hyperref[fig:scn_cot_57_light_light_shaman_interaction_end]{Again}, displacements
follow order of entranced Shaman's steps.

Dark Pawn is displaced from field 5 early into trance-journey onto shared
displacement-field 23. This prevents light Knight to be displaced from field 9
onto the same field.

\end{figure}

It's possible to displace piece between step-fields of an entranced Shaman. In the
example above, dark Bishop could be displaced from field 2 back onto field 1 (i.e.
displacement field 37). Since piece is displaced only after it has been reached by
entranced Shaman, field 1 has been already travelled over by the Shaman.

\end{figure}

Such a displacement (when piece is displaced onto field already travelled over
by entranced Shaman) is called backward displacement.

Above, entranced Shaman can only continue to move forward (green), backward
displaced piece (here, dark Bishop) is now on a travelled-over path (grey),
and thus out of reach for the remainder of the trance-journey.

\end{figure}

Here, dark Rook can be displaced from step-field 3 onto step-field 7 (displacement
field 22), which hasn't been travelled over by the Shaman yet.

Such a displacement (when piece is displaced onto field not yet travelled over by
entranced Shaman) is called forward displacement.

\label{fig:scn_cot_69_forward_displacement_step_2}
\end{figure}

Dark Rook can be forward-displaced again, onto step-field 11 (displacement field 22).

Note, dark Rook can also be displaced back onto its starting position, i.e. step-field
3 (displacement field 44), because displacement takes place only after being reached
by entranced Shaman, and so step-field 3 by the time of displacement would be empty.

\end{figure}

\hyperref[fig:scn_hd_06_centaur_off_board]{Again},
light grey fields are virtual fields extending existing chessboard.

Piece can only be displaced onto existing, empty field on chessboard. So, dark Rook
can't be forward-displaced any more, as next step-field 15 (displacement field 22)
lies outside of chessboard, together with all fields marked red. Dark Rook can still
be displaced onto fields marked blue.

Shaman starting a cascade can also be activated later during the very same cascade,
which gives it an option to go onto trance-journey.

If ends in a trance-journey, such a cascade is said to feature push-pull entrancement.
This is basically
\hyperref[sec:Terms/Push-pull activation]{push-pull activation} of a Shaman, ending
in a trance-journey.

If not starting a cascade, Shaman can be activated twice in the same cascade, and
entrance itself into a trance-journey.

In all cases, to qualify as a self-entrancement, there should be no other Shamans
in a cascade between starting a cascade/first activation and final activation of
a Shaman undertaking trance-journey.

\section*{Promotion}

Promotion in this variant is enforced, immediate. So, Pawns cannot be tagged
for promotion. Pawn has to be promoted immediately upon reaching
\hyperref[sec:Terms/Figure row]{opponent's figure row},
just like in a Classical Chess.

Alternatively, Pawn has to be promoted immediately when reached by own Pyramid
on opponent's side of a chessboard, like in
\hyperref[sec:Mayan Ascendancy/Pyramid/Promotion]{Mayan Ascendancy variant}.

Promotion in this variant is polygamous, more than one Queen in the same color
can be present on chessboard at any given time.

Castling is

between 2 and 9 fields across. All other constraints from Nineteen variant still
applies.
