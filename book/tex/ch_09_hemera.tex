Hemera's Dawn is chess variant which is played on 20~$\times$~20 board,
with darkish red-brown and grey fields and pure red and bright yellow
pieces. Star colors are bright blue and white.
Three new pieces are introduced; Centaur, Scout, and Grenadier.

Centaur is similar to Unicorn, only it can continue its jumpy movement
in two chosen directions until another piece is encountered, or it runs
out of a chessboard.

First direction is chosen freely, second direction is limited by the first
choice. Once both long and short jump directions are determined, Centaur
has to follow them in all subsequent steps, for the remainder of that ply.

For Centaur's ply to be legal, all steps must end up on the chessboard.
Unlike Wave, Centaur cannot step outside of a chessboard, and in later
step(s) return back onto it.

On fields with the same color as Centaur, it has the same step-fields (green, blue)
as Knight has.

\mbox{}\newline % Forcing new paragraph ...
On fields in opposite color, Centaur can jump much longer, and has the same step-fields
(green, blue) as Unicorn has. For comparison, short steps are also numbered (grey).

Again, just as Knight (and Unicorn), Centaur is not hampered by a piece on any
unmarked field.

\mbox{}\newline % Forcing new paragraph ...
Step-fields are also capture-fields, Centaur would be able to capture opponent's
pieces on any marked field, regardless of marker color (green, blue).
\end{minipage}

\vspace*{0.7\baselineskip}
On initial step, Centaur can freely choose any marked field, regardless of marker
color (green, blue), or step (long, short). On second step, Centaur can choose any
step-field in the other color (blue if green was chosen initially, green if blue
was first choice). On all subsequent steps, Centaur has to keep alternating between
the two initially chosen steps, for the remainder of a ply.

\caption{Centaur initial step}
\label{fig:scn_hd_03_centaur_multi_step_init}
\end{figure}

Here, light Centaur is located on the same color (i.e. light) field, so all available
step-fields are short jumps, which are the same as those of Knight. For the first step,
Centaur can choose any of marked step-fields, except the one which is blocked by own
piece (light Pawn).

\end{figure}

Here, after first step, light Centaur is located on a dark field, so all available
step-fields are long jumps, which are the same as those of Unicorn. Since upper-left
step-field (blue) was chosen for a first step, next step has to be one of upper-right,
lower-left fields (green). Note, opponent's piece (dark Pawn) can be captured, but it
blocks light Centaur from moving any further.

\label{fig:scn_hd_05_centaur_multi_step}
\end{figure}

After second step is chosen, complete movement of Centaur consists of alternating
between the two initial steps. Centaur for the rest of a ply has to follow those two
initial steps, e.g. after reaching field 6, it cannot move to any other step-field
(red). Light Centaur could also capture dark Bishop, but is prevented from moving
any further (grey). Pieces on all other fields are ignored (Pawns).

Here, light grey fields are virtual fields extending existing chessboard. For
Centaur, it's illegal to step outside of a chessboard, and all subsequent steps
are also illegal.

Here, Centaur cannot reach fields 1 and 2 from starting position with selected
directions, even though it would end movement on the chessboard.

\end{figure}

Wave activated by Centaur, \hyperref[fig:scn_hd_01_centaur_same_color]{moves like one}.
Here, light Wave is activated on the opposite color (i.e. dark) field, so all available
step-fields are long jumps, which are the same as those of Unicorn. For the first step,
Wave can choose any of marked step-fields (green, blue), including the one occupied by
own piece (light Pawn). Light Pawn could be activated, or stepped over.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\caption{Wave activation by Centaur, second step}
\label{fig:scn_hd_08_wave_activation_by_centaur_second_step}
\end{figure}

After first step, light Wave is located on a light field, so all available step-fields
are short jumps, which are the same as those of Knight. Since upper-right step-field
(green) was chosen for a first step, next step has to be one of upper-left, lower-right
fields (blue). Light Wave cannot activate opponent's piece (dark Pawn), but it can step
over it.

\caption{Wave activation by Centaur}
\label{fig:scn_hd_09_wave_activation_by_centaur_complete}
\end{figure}

After second step is chosen, complete movement of Wave consists of alternating between
the two initially chosen steps, which Wave for the rest of a ply has to follow, e.g.
after reaching field 4, it cannot move to any other step-field (red). Light Wave could
also activate dark Wave, or it could continue moving further. Pieces on all other fields
are ignored (Pawns).

\label{fig:scn_hd_10_wave_activated_by_centaur_off_board}
\end{figure}

Again, light grey fields are virtual fields extending existing chessboard.
Wave activated by Centaur can step outside of a board, as long as its ply
ends on a board, just like
\hyperref[fig:scn_mv_034_wave_off_board]{Wave activated by Unicorn}. Here,
step-fields 1 and 2 are reachable by Wave, even though it stepped outside
of the board. It is illegal for any piece, including Wave, to end its ply
outside of a board.

\end{figure}

Activation by Centaur and following teleportation of Wave is
\hyperref[fig:scn_n_07_teleport_wave_init]{exactly the same as if activated by Unicorn},
except Wave can now carry more than 1 momentum, because Centaur's ply can be
longer than just 1 step.

\section*{Scout}

\vspace*{-1.3\baselineskip}
\caption{Scout}
\label{fig:13_scout}
\end{wrapfigure}
Scout is more mobile relative of a Pawn. Like Pawn, Scout can rush, and can be captured
by en passant. Also like Pawn, Scout can capture opponent's rushing privates (Pawns,
Scouts, Grenadiers) by en passant. Unlike Pawn, Scout cannot be promoted. Pawns can be
promoted to Scouts.

\vspace*{-1.3\baselineskip}
\caption{Scout movement}
\label{fig:scn_hd_15_scout_movement}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Scout can make a few steps forward (towards opponent's initial positions), and
to the sides. Forward movement is the same as Pawn's; light Scout moves straight
upwards, while dark Scout moves straight downwards. Count of steps Scout can make
depends on size of a chessboard; in this variant Scout can make up to 5 steps in
each direction.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

Scout can also capture opponent's pieces with its diagonal steps; unlike Pawn's,
those are backwards steps, i.e. towards own initial positions.\newline
\indent
Steps (arrows) are referred to by relative position of its end point (field).
So, capture-steps for light Scout are down-left, down-right diagonals; and for
dark Scout up-left, up-right diagonals.

\vspace*{-0.3\baselineskip}

\caption{Scout capturing}
\label{fig:scn_hd_16_scout_capturing}
\end{wrapfigure}
Like Pawn, Scout can capture only on its first step in a ply, and cannot capture
after it started moving. Here, light Scout can capture dark Knight since it's
first step, but cannot capture dark Bishop after it made 3 steps to the right.

\label{fig:scn_hd_17_scout_forking_steps}
\end{wrapfigure}
Forking steps refer to two diagonal steps available after a step up, down, left
or right is made.\newline
\indent
Forked steps are extension of a first step; so, e.g. after left step only left-up,
and left-down steps are available, but not right-up, right-down.\newline
\indent
Here are shown all forking steps for both light and dark Scout. Light Scout would
use forking step after left, up, or right steps are taken; dark Scout would chose
forking step after left, down, or right steps.

\label{fig:scn_hd_20_scout_rerouting}
\end{wrapfigure}
When Scout's step-fields are not empty, Scout can choose one of associated diagonal,
forking step to move around obstacle. Then, Scout has to continue its movement in
the same direction it was moving before rerouting.

\vspace*{0.9\baselineskip}
\noindent
\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{l}{0.41\textwidth}

\caption{Rerouting first step}
\label{fig:scn_hd_21_scout_rerouting_first_step}
\end{wrapfigure}
\indent
In rerouting examples here blue arrows are used just to distinguish one valid
path over the other, when choice (forking step) is being made.\newline
\indent
First step can also be blocked (including by own piece), direction to follow
after rerouting is the blocked one.

\vspace*{-0.7\baselineskip}
\noindent
\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{l}{0.41\textwidth} % 10 = enough

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
\caption{Continuous rerouting}
\label{fig:scn_hd_22_scout_rerouting_pawn_wall}
\end{wrapfigure}
\indent
If initially chosen direction is blocked after rerouting, Scout can be rerouted
again. Each choice of forking step is independent from any previous choice.\newline
\indent
Here, each time Scout is blocked by any Pawn (own or opponent's), it can choose
between equally valid right-down or right-up forking steps, regardless of any
previous choices.
Dark Wave is transparent piece; so, light Scout can also step over dark Wave (and
reach destination field A), in addition to choosing between two forking steps.

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Activated Scout is limited by both count of steps it can make, and momentum it
received, whichever is lower. In this variant, Scout can make at most 5 steps;
limit depends on size of a chessboard. Here, light Scout is activated by own
Queen via Wave. Wave C is out of reach for light Scout, even though it received
11 momentum.

Activated Scout uses received momentum for movement, and transfers all of
remaining momentum to the piece it activates. Here, light Scout can activate
Wave B, and transfer to it remaining 7 momentum.

Scout can activate Wave on its step-fields. Activated Wave can chose any direction
Scout would be able to take, including any capturing step, even if associated fields
are empty.\newline
\indent
Direction, once chosen, cannot be changed for duration of a ply; so, light Pawn
in this example would remain out of reach.

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Activated Wave can move straight forward, towards opponent's initial positions, or
laterally, to the left or to the right. Wave can also choose Scout's capture-step
as its direction, and move diagonally backwards, towards own initial positions.\newline
\indent
Activated Wave is not limited by received momentum, and so can move until end of a
chessboard is reached. Wave activated on a step-field cannot activate Pyramid.\newline
\indent
This is all similar to

Wave can be activated by Scout on its capture-field, with 1 momentum. The same as
on step-fields, Wave activated on capture-fields can chose any direction Scout would
be able to take at the beginning of its ply; this includes any capturing step, even
if associated fields are empty.\newline
\indent
As before, activated Wave cannot change direction once it starts moving; so, light
Pawn in the very next example is out of reach.

step-fields. Similar to
\hyperref[fig:scn_mv_028_wave_activated_by_capture_pawn]{Wave activated by Pawn on its capture-step},
Wave can also activate Pyramid if chosen direction is Scout's capture-step, i.e.
diagonally backwards, towards own initial positions.\newline
\indent
Here, activated Wave (now "in-the-air") can activate light Pyramid B with 1 momentum;
light Pyramid A cannot be activated, as it's located on Scout's step-field.

\indent
In this, and all subsequent variants, any private (Pawn, Scout, or Grenadier) can
capture any other opponent's private en passant; types of pieces do not need to
match.\newline
\indent
For example, light Scout could capture rushing dark Grenadier en passant, just as
Pawns are able to do the same to rushing opponent's Pawns in Classical Chess.

Capturing rushing opponent's Pawn with Scout is very similar to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant}{en passant with a Pawn},
the only real difference is that Pawn captures at forward, diagonal field,
i.e. towards opponent's initial positions, while Scout captures at diagonal
field backwards, i.e. towards own initial positions.

Here, dark Scout and dark Pawn are both positioned on the same rank, and both
can capture rushing light Pawn en passant; the only difference between capturing
with either of those two pieces are their capture-fields.

In this variant a set of Scouts are added to

Scouts are positioned relative to Centaurs' initial positions, to block them
from capturing opponent's pieces from the very first move.

When starting a ply Grenadier can move to, and capture at different fields

Just like Pawn, Grenadier have capture- and step-fields separated, and so it

When there is no opponent's piece on its grenadier-field, Grenadier can take up
to 3 fields to the left or right, and at most 2 fields up or down; these are
step-fields, so e.g. Pyramid cannot be activated on them (green arrows). Movement
limits depends on size of a chessboard.\newline
\indent
Grenadier can capture only at closest neighboring fields at all 4 diagonals (red
arrows).

Scouts C, D, and Grenadiers E, F.

Rush and en passant are very similar to those in
\hyperref[fig:12_nineteen_en_passant]{Nineteen variant}.
All privates (Pawns, Scouts, and Grenadiers) can be rushed up to, and including,
the last row on own side of a chessboard. All rushed privates can be captured by
any opponent's private en passant, capturing and captured pieces do not need to
be the same type.

In this variant, Pawns and Grenadiers can be rushed 7 (Pawn A, Grenadier E) or 8
(Pawn B, Grenadier F) fields, depending if they were in first or second privates
row. Scouts can be rushed 5 (Scout C) or 6 (Scout D) fields, depending how close
their starting position is to opponent.

Note, first move of a private (any of Pawns, Scouts, and Grenadiers) is always a
rush, if it moves for 2 or more fields forward, regardless of its normal movement
limits.\newline
\indent
For instance, Scouts in this variant can move at most 5 fields forward; outermost
Scouts could reach end of own side of chessboard without rushing. Regardless, first
move of any Scout from its initial position is a rush, and expose it to possible
capture by en passant, if it moves for 2 or more fields forward.

Converted opponent's privates cannot be rushed, even if converted on initial
positions of own privates.
