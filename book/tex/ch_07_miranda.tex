with white and dark violet fields and light magenta and indigo pieces.
A new piece is introduced, Wave.

\end{wrapfigure}
Wave is passive piece, it has to be activated before it can move. Activation is done
with own piece capturing field at which Wave is located, before Wave can move.

Wave inherits step- and capture-fields from activating piece. Once initial step is
made, Wave cannot change its direction. Activated Wave can move over multiple fields,
even if activated by a single-step piece (e.g. a Knight).

Wave does not use received momentum for moving, and so Wave can be activated even
with no momentum. Wave can activate any own piece, except King, if it has momentum.
Wave can also activate other Wave, own or opponent's, even if it has no momentum.
Wave transfers all of received momentum to a piece it activates.

Wave is transparent; all other pieces can move past (step over) Wave, as if it
isn't present on a chessboard. Other pieces are transparent to Wave; Wave can move
past (step over) any piece, as if it isn't there. Transparency of Wave makes
activation of Wave optional.

Wave cannot capture any piece; and so cannot neither check nor checkmate opponent's
King.

\label{fig:scn_mv_001_wave_activation_init}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
A piece can activate own Wave by simply capturing a field at which that Wave stands.
Activation is optional, a piece could just as well move past Wave. Activated Wave
receives any momentum activating piece had.

Here, Pegasus has opportunity to activate Wave, with 5 momentum.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\caption{Wave activated}
\label{fig:scn_mv_002_wave_activated}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Activated Wave inherits way of moving from the activating piece; more specifically,
Wave inherits all initial step- and capture-fields which activating piece would
have when starting a ply. Activated Wave does not spend received momentum for moving,
and so Wave can be activated even if activating piece has no momentum.

Here, Wave activated by Pegasus (now "in the air") moves like one, i.e. along one
chosen semi-diagonal.

\label{fig:scn_mv_003_pawn_pass_through}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Wave in its movement is not obstructed by any piece on chessboard, it can move
past (step over) any piece, as if it's not there. In short, other pieces are
all transparent to Wave, and all activations are optional.

Here, Wave cannot activate opponent's Pawn on its step-field, but it's not
hindered by that Pawn, and can reach fields behind it, which would be out of
reach for Pegasus.

\caption{Activating Rook}
\label{fig:scn_mv_004_wave_activating_rook}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.3\baselineskip}
Wave can activate any own piece, except King, if it has momentum. Wave can also
activate any other Wave, own or opponent's, even if it doesn't have any momentum.
Wave does not spend received momentum while moving, and would transfer it entirely
to any piece it activates.

Here, Wave can activate own Rook, even though it's positioned behind opponent's
Pawn, and transfer to it all of 5 received momentum.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\vspace*{-2.1\baselineskip}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Rook activated}
\label{fig:scn_mv_005_rook_activated}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.3\baselineskip}
Material is any piece, except Wave. Activated material moves the same as it would
in a normal move, i.e. if not activated. The only difference is that activated
material is limited by received momentum, i.e. can't move for more fields than
momentum it received.

Here, activated Rook (now "in the air") can choose one of horizontals or verticals
as its new direction. Rook can reach at most 5 fields, because that's the momentum
it received.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\caption{Rook captures}
\label{fig:scn_mv_006_rook_captures}
\end{figure}

Activated material piece can also capture opponent's piece, if it's within reach,
and not obstructed by other pieces.

Here, activated Rook can capture dark Knight; it can't capture dark Bishop since
own light Pawn is in the way. Light Rook can't capture dark Pegasus since it's out
of reach.

\vspace*{-1.4\baselineskip}
\caption{Wave is transparent}
\label{fig:scn_mv_007_wave_is_transparent}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Just as other pieces are transparent to Wave, so is Wave transparent for all the
other pieces. Any interaction with a Wave is optional; a piece could activate own
Wave, it could capture opponent's Wave, or it could move past all Waves in its path,
and e.g. capture opponent's piece behind a Wave.\newline
\indent
Here, light Queen could capture dark Wave, activate own Wave, or capture dark
Pegasus; dark Pawn is shielded by its Pegasus.

\caption{Wave is not pinned}
\label{fig:scn_mv_008_wave_cant_be_pinned}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Since it's transparent Wave cannot be pinned, i.e. a piece can ignore (step over)
Wave placed on its capture-field, and still check opponent's King.

Here, dark Pegasus checks light King, even though light Wave is on dark Pegasus'
capture-field. Any other piece positioned instead of light Wave would be
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(chess)#Absolute_pin}{hard-pinned},
and light King wouldn't be in check.

\subsubsection*{Wave and castling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Wave and castling}
\label{sec:Miranda's veil/Wave/Cascading Waves/Wave and castling}

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
Wave is transparent, so it doesn't block castling if positioned between castling
pieces and their destination fields. Wave cannot be activated by castling piece,
so it blocks any castling which uses its field as a destination.

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth, keepaspectratio=true]{examples/10_mv/scn_mv_009_wave_no_block_castling_king.png}

\caption{Castling Rook}
\label{fig:scn_mv_010_wave_no_block_castling_rook}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
In previous example King initiated castling by moving onto a field past Wave, Rook
can now finish castling onto empty field between the two, so the whole castling move
is legal.

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
\noindent
\begin{figure}[!h]

\vspace*{-1.4\baselineskip}
\caption{Castling Rook blocked}
\label{fig:scn_mv_011_wave_block_castling_rook}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.4\baselineskip}
If in previous example King initiated castling by moving onto a field just past Wave,
Rook cannot castle onto field occupied by Wave, so the whole castling move is illegal.

\caption{Pawns blocked by Waves}
\label{fig:scn_mv_012_pawn_blocked_by_opponents_wave}
\end{wrapfigure}
Image on the left and the next one both have two examples presented in parallel,
each started by a labeled Pawn.\newline
\indent
To use transparency, a piece has to be able to reach a Wave, and then make another
step away from it, in the same ply. So, single-step piece (i.e. a Pawn, Knight, King,
or Unicorn) has to activate own, or capture opponent's Wave; otherwise it's blocked
by a Wave, regardless if own, or opponent's.

\vspace*{1.1\baselineskip}
\noindent
\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{l}{0.4\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.39375\textwidth, keepaspectratio=true]{examples/10_mv/scn_mv_013_pawn_not_blocked_by_opponents_wave.png}
\vspace*{-1.4\baselineskip}
\caption{Pawns not blocked by Waves}
\label{fig:scn_mv_013_pawn_not_blocked_by_opponents_wave}
\end{wrapfigure}
In previous example light Pawn B is blocked from moving straight forward by dark
Wave on its step-field; other Waves can be either activated, or captured. No Wave
can be stepped over, since both Pawns can make only one step in a ply.\newline
\indent
Here, both Pawns can rush, thus making more than one step in a single ply. Opponent's,
dark Wave is blocking light Pawn B from settling onto step-field it occupies. Even so,
both Waves are transparent to light Pawns; each Pawn can now step over corresponding
Wave, and reach step-fields behind it.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\subsubsection*{Piece blocked}

\label{sec:Miranda's veil/Wave/Activation/Piece blocked}

\vspace*{-1.4\baselineskip}

\caption{Piece blocked}
\label{fig:scn_mv_014_wave_no_activating_blocked_piece}
\end{figure}

Wave cannot activate blocked pieces, even if it has momentum. Here, Pawn is blocked
from moving forward by own Bishop, and there are no opponent's pieces on its
diagonal capture-fields. So, Wave cannot activate Pawn, even though it has one
momentum received from Knight.

\subsection*{Movement}

\caption{Bishop activating Wave}
\label{fig:scn_mv_015_bishop_activating_wave}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Activated Wave inherits choice of initial step-fields and way of movement from
activating piece; so, movement of activated Wave is the same as activating piece
starting a new ply. Wave activated by pieces which can move for only one field
(such as Pawn, Knight, King, and Unicorn) can move over multiple fields, by
repeating initial step multiple times. Again, activating Wave is optional,
activating piece could continue its movement past Wave.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\caption{Wave activated by Bishop}
\label{fig:scn_mv_016_wave_activated_by_bishop}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Activated Wave is not limited by received momentum, and can move past (step over)
any piece as if not present.

Here, Wave (now "in the air") activated by Bishop moves like one, i.e. along one chosen
diagonal. Activated light Wave cannot activate dark Knight, but can activate own Pawn.
Wave is not obstructed by neither Pawn nor Knight, and can move past them. Wave is not
limited by 4 received momentum, and can reach edge of chessboard.

\caption{Knight activating Wave}
\label{fig:scn_mv_017_knight_activating_wave}
\end{figure}

Wave can make multiple steps in a ply, even if activated by a piece which can make only
one step. Activated Wave can take one chosen direction, which cannot be changed later.

Here, Knight is about to activate Wave, and transfer to it one momentum.

\clearpage % ..........................................................

\vspace*{-2.1\baselineskip}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Wave activated by Knight}
\label{fig:scn_mv_018_wave_activated_by_knight}
\end{figure}

Here, Wave (now "in the air") activated by light Knight can choose one semi-diagonal
(corresponding to steps Knight can make), and then move over multiple step-fields, up
to the edge of chessboard. So, Wave activated by Knight moves like a Pegasus.

Similarly, Wave activated by King can choose one direction along diagonals, horizontal
or vertical lines (corresponding to steps King can make).

\label{fig:scn_mv_020_wave_activated_by_king}
\end{figure}

Then, Wave (now "in the air") activated by King can move over multiple step-fields,
up to the edge of chessboard. Direction taken by activated Wave cannot be changed
for duration of a ply. So, Wave activated by King moves like a Queen.

\label{fig:scn_mv_021_wave_activation_by_step_pawn}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Pawn can activate Wave on its step-fields, from which Wave inherits its steps, a
forward step and two diagonal steps.

Even though Wave is transparent, single-step piece (like Pawn here) has to activate
Wave encountered on its step-field. Rushing Pawn (just like other multi-step pieces)
does not have to activate Wave, and can continue rushing further instead.

\label{fig:scn_mv_022_wave_activated_by_step_pawn}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}
Unlike Pawn, Wave can choose any step, including diagonal, even if that step-field
is empty. Wave activated by Pawn (now "in-the-air") can move straight forward or
diagonally, towards opponent's initial positions, until the end of a chessboard.
Activated Wave cannot change direction once it starts moving; so here, light Bishop
is out of reach. Wave activated on a step-field cannot activate any Pyramids.\newline
\indent
Wave activated by rushing Pawn behaves the same, except it receives more momentum.

Wave can be activated by Pawn on its capture-field, with 1 momentum. Activated
Wave inherits the same steps as if activated on Pawn's step-fields; i.e. it moves
straight forward or diagonally, towards opponent's initial positions, until the
end of a chessboard. As before, activated Wave cannot change direction once it
starts moving; so, light Bishop in the very next example is out of reach.
Here, light Pawn is about to activate Wave on its capture-field, giving Wave 1
momentum.

\hyperref[sec:Terms/Activator]{Activator} is material (non-Wave) piece from which
Wave inherits its steps; here, this is light Pawn. Wave cannot capture opponent's
pieces, all of its fields are steps-fields. When referring to Wave's capture-fields
it actually means its activator's capture-fields; here, all fields on diagonals.\newline
\indent
Moving over its capture-fields allows Wave to activate own Pyramids. Here, light
Wave (now "in-the-air") can activate light Pyramid A on its capture-field, but
cannot activate light Pyramid B on its step-field.

Wave, activated by Unicorn on a field with the same color as Wave, has the same step-fields
as Knight has.

Wave activated on a field in opposite color can jump much longer, and has the same step-fields
as Unicorn has. For comparison, short steps are also numbered (grey).

\label{fig:scn_mv_026_wave_opposite_color}
\end{wrapfigure}
On two initial steps, Wave can freely choose any marked fields, regardless if it's long or short step.
If Wave was positioned on same-color field, first step would be short, and second one long; vice versa
if Wave started on opposite-color field. On all subsequent steps, Wave has to keep alternating between
the two initially chosen steps, for the remainder of a ply.

\label{fig:scn_mv_027_wave_activation_by_unicorn_first_step}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-0.3\baselineskip}
Here, light Wave is activated by Unicorn on the same-color (light) field, so all available
step-fields are short jumps, i.e. the same as Knight. For first step, Wave can choose any of
marked step-fields, including the one occupied by own piece (light Pawn on field 2). Normally,
own piece could be activated, leaving Wave in its position. In this particular case, light Pawn
is blocked from moving, so it can't be activated. Light Wave can still choose field 2 as a first
step, only it has to move past light Pawn on it.

\label{fig:scn_mv_028_wave_activation_by_unicorn_second_step}
\end{figure}

Here, after first step, light Wave is located on opposite-color (dark) field, so all available
step-fields are long jumps, which are the same as those of Unicorn. Dark Pawn on field 3 can't be
activated, because it's opponent's piece. Just as with light Pawn in previous example, that does
not prevent light Wave to choose field 3 as its second step, only it has to move over dark Pawn
on it, and continue moving further.

\end{figure}

After second step is chosen, complete movement of Wave consists of alternating between the two initially
chosen steps, which Wave for the rest of a ply has to follow, e.g. after reaching field 4, it cannot move
to any other step-field (red). Light Wave could also activate dark Wave, in which case it would end it's
ply on dark Wave's field, and dark Wave would move away. Pieces on all other non-step fields are ignored
(Pawns).

Here, light grey fields are virtual fields extending existing chessboard.
For Wave, it's legal to step outside of a board, and all subsequent steps
are also legal, as long as its ply ends on a board. So, Wave activated by
Unicorn can reach fields 1 and 2, even though it stepped outside of the
board. It is illegal for any piece, including Wave, to end its ply outside
of a board.

A Wave can also activate other Wave; movement of an activated Wave is the same as
activating Wave. Generally, activated Wave inherits way of movement from activating
piece.

Here, Wave B moves like a Bishop, because activating Wave A moved like a Bishop,
since it was activated by one.

When piece activated in a cascade is not a Wave, it has its own rules of movement, and
Waves activated afterwards inherit them from that activating piece; such a piece is
called activator.

Here, Waves activated after Knight moves like multi-step Knight (i.e. Pegasus), since
Waves are not restricted to only one step, even if activator is. For Waves A, and B
activator is Bishop, while for Waves C, and D activator is Knight.

First piece in a cascade gathers momentum over step-fields traveled. All pieces
transfer all of momentum remaining after movement to the next piece in a cascade.
Wave doesn't spend received momentum for movement, but all other pieces do.

Here, numbers in lower, left corner are received momentum. Bishop gathered 3 momentum,
1 has been spent by Knight, and so activated Pawn can be rushed for only 2 fields.

Activating Pawn in its initial position gives it ability to capture opponent's

All pieces can activate Pyramid on their capture-fields, even if a Pawn in cascade
used step-fields to continue (or start) said cascade (right example, above).

So, if Pyramid can be activated depends solely if last active piece (preceding that
Pyramid in a cascade) traveled over its step- or capture-fields. This is so for all
subsequent activations, what Wave can activate is what last active piece preceding
it in a cascade could activate, with addition of opponent's Wave.

capture-fields; those are just a shorthand for its activator's capture-fields.\newline

To be able to activate Pyramid, Wave activating a Pyramid and its activator has to
move over their capture-fields; other Waves in a cascade can still move over their

In both cases, Wave A moving straight forward over its step-fields is of no consequence,

A piece hard-pinned to its King cannot move in a normal, non-cascading move, since
that would leave King checked. Whether King is checked or checkmated is determined
only after a move (a cascade) has been finished. So, in a cascade one could replace
hard-pinned piece with any other material piece; Wave can't be used since

Again, King is checked (or checkmated) only after cascade has finished; just like

temporary field, and thus repositioned to a new field. So, a piece can temporary
be located on a field where it would check (or checkmate) King, if that would be

King, because all of its momentum has been transferred to Wave B, then C and finally
D. Wave D is now "in the air", about to reactivate light Queen with remaining 5
momentum; grey arrows show path traveled over by piece they point to. After
reactivation, light Queen still won't attack dark King, even though it's located on
light Queen's capture-field, and within range. This is so because being checked (or
checkmated) is a status of a position, after all pieces had settled down, and move
has been done. This means, cascade would have to finish with activated light Queen
settling onto e.g. field 2, or 4, for that Queen to check dark King.

light Wave, dark King isn't checkmated yet since the move is still ongoing. Light
Wave would then activate dark Wave, which would activate dark Rook.

it cannot stay and re-activate piece that has activated it (here, light Wave 2).

\subsection*{En passant}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{En passant}
\label{sec:Miranda's veil/Wave/En passant}

Until this variant the only difference from Classical Chess was the possibility
for a Pawn to rush for more than two fields; otherwise, rush and en passant were
the same as in Classical Chess, and with the same rules still in place:\newline
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En\_passant}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En\_passant}.

Now, due to transparency of Waves, ability to cascade own and opponent's pieces, it's
possible for a Pawn capturing en passant to encounter pieces on its capture-field,
and between a capture-field and a rushed Pawn, immediately after opponent's cascade
has finished.

En passant turns into ordinary capture if a piece on Pawn's capture-field can be
captured, in which case rushed Pawn can't be captured en passant anymore.
En passant is blocked if a piece on a capture-field can't be captured, e.g. if
it's in the same color as capturing Pawn. En passant is denied if rushed Pawn was
(re)activated and moved away from its rushing destination, in the very same
cascade.

In all other cases en passant is still possible; for instance, if a piece on a
capture-field can be activated, or if there are pieces between a capture-field
and a rushed Pawn.

Note, Pawn can capture en passant if it started a move, or on its first ply in a
cascade, if activated. Pawn cannot capture en passant if it has already moved in
the same cascade.

Since \hyperref[fig:scn_mv_007_wave_is_transparent]{Wave is transparent}, rushing
Pawn can step over it, and can continue rushing further. Any piece captured instead
of a rushed Pawn prevents that Pawn being captured en passant.

In a new example on the left similar to previous one, grey arrows show path traveled
over by rushing light Pawn, from its starting field P. Now on dark player's turn,
dark Pawn cannot realize en passant opportunity, and can only capture light Wave
instead, since Wave is positioned on its capture-field E.

Rushing Pawn could also be activated, capturing a figure prevents en passant all
the same; only difference is that momentum gathered has to be enough to also drive
rushing Pawn, and a figure onto en passant capture-field.

momentum.\newline
\indent
Even though dark Pawn is about to be activated with enough momentum and can reach
en passant capture-field E, it cannot capture light Pawn en passant anymore since
dark Pawn was activated, and so that ply is not the very first one in the move.

As shown here, if Pawns already moved in a cascade could capture en passant in their
second, third, ... ply, it would be possible to capture from their initial positions;
that certainly would not be "in passing".

Rush and en passant are identical to those in Classic Chess, only difference
is that Pawn can now move longer on initial turn, up to 6 fields in this
variant.

Promotion is non enforced, delayed variety, i.e. it's the same as in
\hyperref[sec:Age of Aquarius/Promotion]{previous chess variant}, Age of Aquarius.

\section*{Castling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Castling}
\label{sec:Miranda's veil/Castling}

Castling is the same as in Classical Chess, only difference is that King can move between 2 and 6 fields across.
All other constraints from Classical Chess still applies.

Above, all valid King's castling moves are numbered.

\caption{Castling long right}
\label{fig:miranda_s_veil_castling_right_05}
\end{figure}

In this example King was castling long to the right. Initial King's position is marked with "K".
After castling is finished, right Rook ends up at field immediately left to the King.

Again, \hyperref[fig:scn_mv_007_wave_is_transparent]{Wave is transparent}, so it does
not block castling if it's positioned between castling pieces and their destination
fields.
Wave cannot be activated by castling pieces, so Wave blocks both King and Rook from castling
\hyperref[fig:scn_mv_011_wave_block_castling_rook]{onto a field it occupies}.

\label{sec:Miranda's veil/Initial setup}

Compared to initial setup of Age of Aquarius, Wave is inserted between Knight and Unicorn
symmetrically, on both sides of chessboard. This can be seen in the image below:
